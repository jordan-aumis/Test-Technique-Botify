This application is a NASAâ€™s NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service). 

In the page you can see a chart that represent the diameters max an min of each NEO. 

there is a filter if you want to see the NEO of a specific body orbit.

this application is using the Nasa api data https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse?api_key=DEMO_KEY

and to prevent geting the rate limite i created my own JSON file that you can find inside the folder Public, 

i finish to code after 4hours aproximatively finishing the step 1 and about to conclude the step 2 it was a bit of a challenge especially for the time allowed and i also did all my code in one page.
